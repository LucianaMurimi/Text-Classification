# Text-Classification
Text is an extremely rich source of information. 

The objective of this project is therefore to transform unstructured text data into something more useful for analysis and natural language processing (NLP) using spaCy.

The following are ilustrated in the `Text Classification in Python Using spaCY` notebook in this repository:
- tokenization
- cleaning of data; removing stop words
- lemmatization
- part of speech
- entity recognition
- dependacy parsing
- word vector representation
- and finally implementing a model that performs sentiment analysis of reviews classifying the reviews as either positive or negative.
